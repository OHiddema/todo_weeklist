Gorilla week 3: Bootstrap exercise (new project from scrath)

Step 1:
Create a responsive grid with 7 elements for the 7 days of the week.
Responsive: use 4,3,2 or 1 colums, depending on the width.

Step 2:
Add some bootstrap classes to create a nice looking layout.

Step 3:
Add some extra's: add and remove items
Just markup, no functionality, because this is a bootstrap exercise for now!
